        1. The first player will enter a valid\n
        \t\t 4 letter word\n
        2. The second player has 10 turns\n
        \t\t to guess the word\n
        3. If the guessed word and the\n
        \t\t chosen word have the same\n
        \t\t letter in the same position,\n
        \t\t it is a BULL\n
        4. If the guessed word and the\n
        \t\t chosen word have the same\n
        \t\t letter in a different position,\n
        \t\t it is a COW\n
        5. A BULL has a higher priority over\n
        \t\t a COW\n
        6. Based on the number of BULLS\n
        \t\t and COWS in previous guesses,\n
        \t\t the player has to find which\n
        \t\t letters are present\n
        7. When the word is found, or 10\n
        \t\t guesses are over, or the player\n
        \t\t gives up, the game is over and\n
        \t\t the word is revealed
